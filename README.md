# short-term-assistant

#### 1. This repository is created for keeping records of me being a short term assistant from 26.06.22 to 27.07.22(DD/MM/YY) <br>
In the doc, 'download-with-breakpoint.ipynb', these codes are able to download all of the financial reports of companies, which are located in the United States of America, during the period of 2001 to 2021 from a website called [SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/). Also, there are Chinese comments which I hope they can help others understand the function of these codes.
##
In addition, by this 'with breakpoint' quote, it literally means what it said. You can stop the code whenever you want. Later on, continuing your download progress where you stopped.

#### 2. Job Experience
I had a Python Course when I was in the first semester of my sophomore year. In that course, I learned about the knowledge of using Python to do Web Crawler. However, I never got a chance to use this skill to accomplish a formal project, the extent's always been small.<br>
## 
So this assistant job not only help me strengthen my basic Web Crawling skills, but also give me a lot of challenges. By keep trying and searching for solutions, I've learned a lot while solving these problems, like how to avoid being detected as a Robotics cause of downloading large amount of data in a small period of time by adding headers(user-agent/cookie), how to create breakpoint in loops to stop at any time or to restart when there is an error occured, etc.
